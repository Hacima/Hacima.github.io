            <p>I am Micah Obal, a 20-something programmer, web developer and music instructor. </p>
            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>Music has always been my first love. I started learning piano when I was around 6 years old. At the age of 10 I took up cello, and at 15 I started learning guitar. Now I play pretty much any instrument I can get my hands on, but my main instruments will always remain piano and guitar.</p>
            <p>I pursued an associates in music education from tulsa community college, and my experience there was very positive. I eventually switched majors, but the knowledge I gained from the music classes there encouraged me to go into private teaching. I currently teach 20 to 30 individual students, many of which have been taking lessons from me continuously for years. I offer lessons in guitar, piano, bass, ukulele, as well as non-instrumental lessons in music theory and its applications.</p>
            <p>I also dabble a bit in writing my own music. You can find that <a href="https://soundcloud.com/atlas_t">here</a>, if you're so inclined.</p>
            <h2>Programming and Web Development</h2>
            <p>While pursuing my music education degree, I took a few computer science courses and knew immediately that this was something I needed more of. I switched majors to computer science and dived into the world of C++, Java, and web development. The classes at TCC were, regretfully, not extremely robust. I enjoy utilizing online resources to help fill in the gaps of my education. Currently I am working through <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> and learning twice as much as the classes I took at TCC. I do not regret my time at TCC at all, and without it, I wouldn't be nearly as motivated to learn this challenging, dense, and extremely rewarding field. The professors there are great resources of knowledge, and I plan on continuing my education to get my BA at some point in the future.</p>
            <p>While by no means a professional web developer, I've done some freelance work for a few people. You can see those websites <a href="/websites.html">here</a>.</p>
            <p>You can follow my progress at my <a href="https://github.com/Hacima">github</a>, where I have been challenging myself to program every day for at least a year.</p>
