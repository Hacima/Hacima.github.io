                    <b><u>Studio Lessons</u></b><br />
                    <i>My studio lessons are my most affordable options, and allow me to use all of my gear and music to make your lesson as educational and engaging as possible! I am conveiniently located near 91st & Memorial.</i>
                    <br />
                    <b>Individual</b> - No contract, no sign-up fee, simply pay as you go. Payment is due at the time of your lesson. This is a great option for students who aren't sure if lessons are for them yet! $40 for an hour lesson. <br />
                    <b>Monthly</b> - A flat, monthly rate that guarantees you at least 4 lessons a month. This is perfect for students ready to make a commitment to mastering their instrument. $80 for half-hour lessons and $140 for hour lessons.<br />
                    <b>Semester</b> - For students who are planning on taking lessons indefinitely, the semester plan lets you pay for three months in advance at a reduced rate. $220 for half-hour lessons and $380 for hour lessons.

                    <b><u>Lessons At Your Home</u></b><br />
                    <i>For many students, it's much more conveinient to have their instructor come to them. All you need is a quiet room, a music stand and two chairs to start taking lessons in the comfort of your own home! For busy parents, this service can be a lifesaver. I am currently only offering 45-minute lessons for at-home students.</i>
                    <br />
                    <b>Individual</b> - Due to the expenses and extra time required to drive to students, I am not currently offering individual lessons outside of the initial free meet-and-greet lesson. <br />
                    <b>Monthly</b> - $140 for a month of 45-minute lessons.<br />
                    <b>Semester</b> - $380 for 3 months of 45-minute lessons.
