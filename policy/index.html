                <b>Tuition</b> - Tuition is to be paid in accordance with your chosen lesson plan. Individual lesson tuition is due before each lesson, monthly tuition is due at the first lesson of each month, and semester tuition is due at the first lesson of each semester.<br />
                <b>Cancellations</b> - 24-hours notice must be given if a student must cancel, otherwise no make-up lesson will be given. If an instructor must cancel, a makeup lesson will be issued or a credit proportional to the amount of lessons cancelled will be applied to the next tuition bill, at the discretion of the teacher. Cancellations due to weather, health or other causes will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.<br />
                <b>Holidays</b> -
                We tend to follow the Tulsa Public School calendar. If your lesson is canceled due to a holiday, your tuition will be discounted to match.
                <br />
                <b>Practice</b> - All students must practice. It is dreadfully obvious when a student has neglected their assigned material, and it discourages both the student and the teacher. Sometimes finding the motivation to practice can be difficult, and we are willing to work with all students on this issue, but continued failure to practice will ultimately result in the student losing their lesson slot.
